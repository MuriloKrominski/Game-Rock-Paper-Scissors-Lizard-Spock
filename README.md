# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock 🖖

Welcome to **Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock**, a simple, fun, and absolutely **nerdy** game. Inspired by the iconic series **The Big Bang Theory**, this game adds two new moves (`Lizard` and `Spock`) to the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game.

In the episode “The Lizard-Spock Expansion,” Sheldon Cooper introduces this variant as a more interesting way to resolve disputes (and statistically less likely to result in ties). Now, you can experience this expansion directly in your terminal!

## 📜 Game Rules

The basic rules are expanded to accommodate the two new moves:

1. **Scissors cuts Paper**  
2. **Paper covers Rock**  
3. **Rock crushes Lizard**  
4. **Lizard poisons Spock**  
5. **Spock smashes Scissors**  
6. **Scissors decapitates Lizard**  
7. **Lizard eats Paper**  
8. **Paper disproves Spock**  
9. **Spock vaporizes Rock**  
10. **Rock crushes Scissors**

As you can see, the interactions are as creative as they are nerdy! 😄
